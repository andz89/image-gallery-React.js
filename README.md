Image gallery project's GitHub source! 

In this project, I used React to create a gorgeous and responsive image gallery. The gallery is powered by a free API, which allows us to access a massive library of gorgeous photographs.
I've also used intelligent pagination to display 10 photographs every page, delivering a pleasant and easy-to-use user experience. This tool allows users to easily navigate through our extensive image collection.

The photo gallery features a wide variety of images, ranging from magnificent landscapes to adorable animals and everything in between. Users may quickly scroll through the images with seamless pagination, with each page displaying a handpicked mix of intriguing images.
